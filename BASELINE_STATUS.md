# Baseline Status - Pre-Optimization

**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Version:** v2.0.0-simplified
**Tag:** v2.0.0-pre-optimization

## Test Results

```
Total tests: 5
Passed: 4
Failed: 1
Success Rate: 80%
```

## Working Components ✅
- Database models: ✅ OK
- Service modules: ✅ OK (AI, PDF, Synthesis, QA)
- Configuration: ✅ OK
- AI Service mock responses: ✅ OK

## Known Issues ⚠️
1. **Main app fails to import** due to hard dependency on `anthropic` library
   - Location: `backend/services/ai_manager.py:19`
   - Issue: Uses `import anthropic` instead of try/except block
   - Impact: App won't start without AI libraries installed
   - Fix: Make AI libraries truly optional (planned for Phase 1)

## Baseline Metrics
- Backend LOC: 5,102 lines (19 files)
- Root-level Python files: 12 files (277KB - likely unused/legacy)
- Test coverage: Unknown (only system tests exist)
- API endpoints: 37 (documented)
- Frontend pages: 5 main pages

## Next Steps
Proceed with optimization plan starting with Phase 1: Code Organization & Cleanup
