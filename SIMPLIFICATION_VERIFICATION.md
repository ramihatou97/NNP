# Simplification Verification Report

## Executive Summary
✅ **CONFIRMED**: Simplification ONLY removed collaboration/multi-user features and security overhead. ALL neurosurgical functionality was retained and even enhanced.

## What Was REMOVED (Multi-User/Collaboration Only)

### 1. User Management & Authentication
**Original `User` model fields removed:**
- `email`, `username`, `hashed_password` - Authentication credentials
- `is_active`, `is_superuser` - User roles/permissions
- Multi-user relationships: `author`, `user` foreign keys

**Replaced with:**
- `UserPreferences` - Single user settings (learning preferences, theme, etc.)
- No authentication requirements
- No password management
- No user roles/permissions

### 2. Collaboration Features
**Removed:**
- `UserInteraction` model - Tracking interactions between multiple users
- User-specific `author` relationships on chapters
- User-specific `user` relationships on QA sessions
- Multi-user activity tracking

### 3. Security Overhead
**Removed:**
- HIPAA compliance infrastructure
- Session management (SessionProvider)
- JWT authentication
- Password hashing/validation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- User registration/login endpoints
